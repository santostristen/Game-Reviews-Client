# Game Review Client

Users can submit there own review to their favorite games. Using JavaScript, jQuery, and HTML.

# Planning

I started this project by sorting out all of the user functions. I was able to get the user to be able to Sign Up to the website, Sign In to the website, change their password when they are signed in, and also Sign Out of the website. After I got all of the user functions working the way they are intended I went on to having only the Sign Up and sign in forms visible and then when the user signs into their account the sign out and change password forms will be visible. Once I had the User functionality figured out I moved onto submitting reviews. Using API requests along with JavaScript I was able to have an authenticated user be able to submit their reviews.

# User Stories

    1. As a user I want to be able to Sign Up to the website.
    2. As a user I want to be able to sign in with what I signed up with.
    3. As a user I want to be able to change my password if needed.
    4. As a user I want to be able to post my reviews
    5. As a user I want to be able to see the reviews I have posted

# Technologies Used
  1. jQuery
  2. HTML/CSS
  3. JavaScript

# To Be Completed
